The code interfaces with sensors(thermistor) and give the output in 16*2 LCD with calibrated values

It uses the temperature value of the thermistor to change the value of temperature given in the thermistor and also changes 
the color of the background of LCD according to the intensity of heat.

It also detects the value of LDR and when the value of a intensity of light is below a particular intensity it switches the
led on which feature can be used in street lights and again the values are well calibrated and mapped.
